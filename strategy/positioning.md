# Positioning

Positioning is a process to identify what boldly differentiates a brand in the mind of a customer. Customers are overwhelmed with choices. Positioning has the potential to create new openings in an oversaturated, continually changing marketplace. Effective brand positioning can extent to which a brand is perceived as favourable, different, and credible in consumers minds. Simply put it's about identifing the `GAP` in the market.
