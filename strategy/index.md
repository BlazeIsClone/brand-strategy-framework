# Brand Strategy Introduction

An Effective brand strategy provides a central, unifying idea around which all behavior, actions, and communications are aligned. It works across products and services, and is effective over time. The best brand strategies are so differentiated and powerful that they deflect the competition. They are easy to talk about, whether you are the CEO
or an employee.

A brand strategy helps you understand who you are and acts as a blueprint to help you communicate it. This process can be broken into a few distinct parts. The core of your brand, to the articulation of your Brand Messaging (how you talk about who you are), to the Visual Identity (the visual expression of your brand). By the end, we’ll have a full brand strategy, summed up in fresh brand guidelines to help us bring the brand to life.

A brand strategy is the foundation for the brand's visual identity (visual language). The brand strategy will help us to:

- Understand who you truly are and use your beliefs and values to guide your decisions in ways that are better for your people, your business, and the future.
- Communicate your brand consistently and effectively through every piece of content you make.
- Attract the right customers to build a strong, lasting brand.
- Position your brand in a way that helps you compete now—and tomorrow.

Follow these steps sequentially , and we’ll end up with a comprehensive brand strategy that helps us to share our story impactfully and effectively at every touchpoint.
