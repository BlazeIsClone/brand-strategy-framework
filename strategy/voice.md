# Voice

People don't fall for corporations, people fall in love with presonalities. The brand voice is the way we talk to our audience and is defined by the brand's style of communication.

#### 1. When people interact with our brand, how do we want them to feel?

#### 2. What adjectives would we use to describe our brand?

#### 3. What does our competition sound like?

#### 4. What is another brand with a voice we love?

#### 5. If our brand were a celebrity, who would we be?

#### 6. How do we want to talk about ourselves?

#### 7. What would the organization say and how?

#### 8. How would the organization speak to users during the different stages of their experience (Tone Mapping)?

#### 9. What does it hate?

#### 10. What does it love?

## Examples

**Mailchimp**

At Mailchimp, we’ve walked in our customers' shoes, and we know marketing technology is a minefield of confusing terminology. That’s why we speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we’d had way back when.

We treat every hopeful brand seriously. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.

Using offbeat humor and a conversational voice, we play with language to bring joy to their work. We prefer the subtle over the noisy, the wry over the farcical. We don't take ourselves too seriously.

Whether people know what they need from us or don’t know the first thing about marketing, every word we say informs and encourages. We impart our expertise with clarity, empathy, and wit.

All of this means that when we write copy:

- We are plainspoken. We understand the world our customers are living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because businesses come to Mailchimp to get to work, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion.

- We are genuine. We get small businesses because we were one not too long ago. That means we relate to customers’ challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way.

- We are translators. Only experts can make what’s difficult look easy, and it’s our job to demystify B2B-speak and actually educate.

- Our humor is dry. Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We’re weird but not inappropriate, smart but not snobbish. We prefer winking to shouting. We’re never condescending or exclusive—we always bring our customers in on the joke.
