# Mission

A mission statement is defined as an action-based statement that declares the purpose of an organization and how they serve their customers. This sometimes includes a description of the company, what it does, and its objectives. A mission statement is a short summary of your company's purpose.

### 1. How can the organization achieve its vision?

What is the single thing the organization is working towards and how is it going to be done.

### 2. What are they here to do? How do they create that future?

This statement should capture the key elements of the organization’s past and present and imagine the future and how would things be changed or evolved.
