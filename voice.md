# Voice

People don't fall for corporations, people fall in love with presonalities. The brand voice is the way we talk to our audience and is defined by the brand's style of communication.

#### 4. What is another brand with a voice we love?

#### 5. If our brand were a celebrity, who would we be?

#### 6. How do we want to talk about ourselves?

#### 7. What would the organization say and how?

#### 8. How would the organization speak to users during the different stages of their experience (Tone Mapping)?

#### 9. What does it hate?
