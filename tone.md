# Tone

Our brand’s tone is basically your general attitude. We have the same voice all the time, but our tone changes. We might use one tone when we're out to dinner with our closest friends, and a different tone when we're in a meeting with our boss. Our tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person we’re addressing. We wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as we would with someone who’s laughing.

## Examples

**Mailchimp**

Mailchimp’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

Mailchimp has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.
