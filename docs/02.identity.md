# The Identity

It is worth noting that ‘Identity’ in context to brand can often mean the visual identity (visual language) of a brand such as the logo, colours and types etc. But in this context we use the term ‘Identity’ to describe the one thing that your organisation stands for, or does the best. The aim is for this attribute is to be unique to your organisation.

All your brand strategy must reference and be based upon this one core attribute. This gives focus, ideally you want your customers to think of one thing that you do well, one thing you stand for, rather than diluting the experience your customers have by attempting to push several attributes or messages.

## Extended Identity

This step is designed to add detail to your core identity and to give a richer understanding and description of what the brand stands for and what it should be communicating.

### Brand as product

By relating your brand to a product, you understand those tangible things consumers want - price point, quality etc.

### Brand as person

By relating your brand to a person you develop your brand's personality and get understanding on how a consumer might develop an emotional relationship with your brand.

### Brand as organisation

Brand as organisation is all about defining your business culture - the attributes of your organisation. A culture of innovation, for example, is fostered by the people and values that make up your business.

### Brand as symbol

lastly brand as symbol explores the visual: is there imagery that best sums up what you stand for and how you wish to be perceived?
