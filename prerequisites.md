# Prerequisites

If you’re starting your brand strategy from scratch or trying to do things the “right” way this time, there are two key pieces of information you need to know beforehand. They are as follows:

#### 1. Who are you for

Who are you trying to sell to? What do they need/want? How are their needs not being met?

To build a brand strategy that helps you genuinely connect with people, you need to know exactly who you’re selling to. Knowing who they are and how you’re trying to serve them can actually bring clarity to who you are (e.g., your Brand Heart) and how you communicate with them.

- Create Personas.

#### 2. Who are you against

Who shares your space? Who will you be competing with for attention? How might they outshine you?

This is invaluable information to help you identify who you are and who you aren’t, how you fit in or stand out, and how you can communicate your differences through your brand strategy.
