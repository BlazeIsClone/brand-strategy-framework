# Prerequisites

If we’re starting the brand strategy from scratch or trying to do things the “right” way this time, there are two key pieces of information we need to know beforehand. They are as follows:

#### 1. Who are we for?

Who are we trying to sell to? What do they need/want? How are their needs not being met?

To build a brand strategy that helps us genuinely connect with people, we need to know exactly who we’re selling to. Knowing who they are and how we’re trying to serve them can actually bring clarity to who we are and how we communicate with them.

#### 2. Who are we against?

Who shares our space? Who will we be competing with for attention? How might they outshine us?

This is invaluable information to help us identify who we are and who we aren’t, how we fit in or stand out, and how we can communicate our differences through our brand strategy.
