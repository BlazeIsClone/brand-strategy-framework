## Framework Overview

By referencing this brand framework we can make sure that all audience communications and messages are supported by, and evolved from, a set of brand values that make up our brand's personality. A well defined brand strategy can help position an organisation against its competitors, find a niche in the market and influence perceptions customers have. This framework is focused on scaffolding a solid foundation for building scalable brand identities.
