Throwing some ideas together with a logo is not a brand strategy. It’s certainly part of creating the brand, but it also includes what your goals are, who your customers are, what your brand stands for, what is the long-term vision for the brand. A well-executed brand strategy has the ability to influence the entire business or ultimately the industry as a whole.

## Framework Overview

By using a brand framework you can make sure that all customer communications and messages are supported by, and evolved from, a set of brand values that make up your brands personality. A well defined brand personality can help position an organisation against its competitors, find a niche in the market and influence perceptions customers have. This framework is focused on building a solid foundation for these tangible associations which has the ability to influence the brand personality. You may use this framework as a pathway and may modify or reproduce without any restriction.
