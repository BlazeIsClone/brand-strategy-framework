## Brand Strategy Introduction

Before we start, these are the stages which a brand has to go though before entering to the market:

1. Conducting research
2. Clarifying strategy
3. Designing identity
4. Creating touchpoints
5. Managing assets

## Framework Overview

This Branding Framework is a reference guide focused on scaffolding a solid foundation for building scalable brand identities. By referencing this brand framework we can make sure that all audience communications and messages are supported by, and evolved from, a set of brand values that make up our brand's personality. A well defined brand strategy can help position an organisation against its competitors, find a niche in the market and influence perceptions customers have.
