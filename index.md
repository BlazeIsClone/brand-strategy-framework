## Brand Strategy Introduction

According to Marty Neumeier `"Brand strategy is a plan for the systematic development of brand in alignment with a business strategy."`

Before we start, this is the timeline of a brand before going to the market.

1. Product/service idea
2. Brand Strategy (we are here now!)
3. Brand Visual Identity
4. Marketing

A brand strategy helps you understand who you are and acts as a blueprint to help you communicate it. This process can be broken into a few distinct parts. The core of your brand, to the articulation of your Brand Messaging (how you talk about who you are), to the Visual Identity (the visual expression of your brand). By the end, we’ll have a full brand strategy, summed up in fresh brand guidelines to help us bring the brand to life.

A brand strategy is the foundation for the brand's visual identity (visual language). The brand strategy will help us to:

- Understand who you truly are and use your beliefs and values to guide your decisions in ways that are better for your people, your business, and the future.
- Communicate your brand consistently and effectively through every piece of content you make.
- Attract the right customers to build a strong, lasting brand.
- Position your brand in a way that helps you compete now—and tomorrow.

## Framework Overview

By referencing this brand strategy framework you can make sure that all customer communications and messages are supported by, and evolved from, a set of brand values that make up your brands personality. A well defined brand strategy can help position an organisation against its competitors, find a niche in the market and influence perceptions customers have. This framework is focused on building a solid foundation for the brand strategy which then can be used as a blueprint for building the brand visual identity (visual language).
