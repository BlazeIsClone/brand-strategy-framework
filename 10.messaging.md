# Messaging

Brand voice is the way you talk to your customers and is defined by your brand's style of communication.

#### 1. What confuses people the most about what we do?

#### 2. A paragraph that explains who you are and what you do?

#### 3. Condense that paragraph into one line and inject brand personality?

#### 4. Condense even further to form a tagline?

#### 5. Value Proposition?
